# My Favorite Projects
This is a repository where I introduce my projects that I like the most.

## Qute Fighters
Source codes: <a href="https://github.com/ugurozdemir97/QuteFighters">Qute Fighters</a>
QuteFighters is a 2D fighting game that allows two players to play locally using the same keyboard. I developed this game to learn about the Qt framework and C++. I created all the animations, drawings, and sound effects myself. The name "Qute Fighters" comes from the framework I used "Qt" and that I find the characters to be "cute". The game is not complete yet. I plan to add online gameplay functionality in the future. Additionally, I intend to redesign the entire UI, which currently just consist of simple buttons. 

Character selection screen looks like this. Currently there are only 2 characters but to test selection screen I've duplicated the characters.

I created a parallax effect using some math and trial errors that will make the map looks 3D when the characters move.

This is all the moves a character has.

For more details about the game check the source code's readme file.

## Noodle
Source codes: <a href="https://github.com/ugurozdemir97/Noodle">Noodle</a>
It is a simple chatting application that I named "Noodle" based on people's complex relationships. However, it is not a completed project. For example, in order to prevent a possible bot software from sending messages repeatedly and crashing the system, the message sending feature has a rate limiter that prevents users from sending more than three messages per second. However, this feature is not available, for example, when changing the username. The reason for this is not that I can't add it, of course, but that I don't need it in an application I wrote just to see what I can do.

It has a password checker that tells you how secure your password is.

It is responsive

You can crop and upload images

There is a notification system that notifies the users when someone add them as friends. Adding a friend looks like this. You can also see your friends' online status and last seen dates.

It has emoji and message quoting system. And it will automatically scroll you to the last message you saw when you open a chat.

## Artificial intelligence application that reads your handwriting
Source codes: <a href="https://github.com/ugurozdemir97/Hand-Written-Digit-Reader">Hand Written Digit Reader</a> 
Using Numpy, I had written an artificial intelligence that learned to read the numbers in the MNIST dataset. I got a lot of help from the internet while doing that. Therefore, I wanted to add something original in it and integrated the artificial intelligence from that software into a GUI program. This program simply takes your drawing and converts it (in terms of image and resolution) into the data resembles the data in MNIST dataset. In this way, artificial intelligence can recognize your drawing and make predictions. Moreover, it is possible to train artificial intelligence with your drawings. This is entirely my own and an original idea that I created without any help.

You shoul write the correct answer before sending the image for the AI to predict, it won't look at the answer before predicting your digit. This way you can teach and let the AI become better at predicting.
