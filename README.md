This is a repository where I introduce my projects that I like the most. Please wait a little for the gifs to upload :)

## Competitive Sudoku
My friend Ümit Yasin Çoban and I have developed and published a mobile app called Competitive Sudoku, now available on both iOS and Android.

We created it for people who love mental challenges and have a competitive spirit. You can solve puzzles across five difficulty levels, track your performance, use five different assists, and climb the leaderboards by competing with other players in competitive mode, where hints and assists are disabled. You can achieve one of nine different ranks, based on a rating system that compares your solves with other players.

We built this project from the ground up with a focus on clean design, smooth gameplay, and meaningful competition.
If you're a Sudoku enthusiast, enjoy logic puzzles, or are just curious, we'd love for you to give it a try!

## Qute Fighters
Source codes: <a href="https://github.com/ugurozdemir97/QuteFighters-v0.2">Qute Fighters</a>

QuteFighters is a 2D fighting game that allows two players to play locally or online. I developed this game to learn about the Qt framework and C++. I created all the animations, drawings, and sound effects myself. The name "Qute Fighters" comes from the framework I used "Qt" and that I find the characters to be "cute". The game is not complete yet. The online gameplay has synchronization issues that I need to address by adding a client prediction and roll back mechanism but local gameplay has no issues.

I created a parallax effect using some math and trial errors that will make the map looks 3D when the characters move.

This is all the moves a character has.

## Noodle
Source codes: <a href="https://github.com/ugurozdemir97/Noodle">Noodle</a>

It is a simple chatting application that I named "Noodle" based on people's complex relationships. However, it is not a completed project. For example, in order to prevent a possible bot software from sending messages repeatedly and crashing the system, the message sending feature has a rate limiter that prevents users from sending more than three messages per second. However, this feature is not available, for example, when changing the username. The reason for this is not that I can't add it, of course, but that I don't need it in an application I wrote just to see what I can do.

It has a password checker that tells you how secure your password is.

![PasswordChecker](https://github.com/ugurozdemir97/myprojects/assets/64408736/12a30b88-0ec1-4d82-886d-c45c076a9811)

It is responsive

You can crop and upload images

There is a notification system that notifies the users when someone add them as friends. Adding a friend looks like this. You can also see your friends' online status and last seen dates.

It has emoji and message quoting system. And it will automatically scroll you to the last message you saw when you open a chat.

## Artificial intelligence application that reads your handwriting
Source codes: <a href="https://github.com/ugurozdemir97/Hand-Written-Digit-Reader">Hand Written Digit Reader</a> 

Using Numpy, I had written an artificial intelligence that learned to read the numbers in the MNIST dataset. I got a lot of help from the internet while doing that. Therefore, I wanted to add something original in it and integrated the artificial intelligence from that software into a GUI program. This program simply takes your drawing and converts it (in terms of image and resolution) into the data resembles the data in MNIST dataset. In this way, artificial intelligence can recognize your drawing and make predictions. Moreover, it is possible to train artificial intelligence with your drawings. This is entirely my own and an original idea that I created without any help.

You shoul write the correct answer before sending the image for the AI to predict, it won't look at the answer before predicting your digit. This way you can teach and let the AI become better at predicting.

## A simple project with React.js and Nest.js where you can do basic CRUD operations:
Source codes: <a href="https://github.com/ugurozdemir97/Assignment">Assignment</a> 

I built this project as part of a job assignment using TypeScript and React.js for the frontend, and Nest.js for the backend. It’s a very basic app so I didn’t want to overcomplicate things or take it too seriously. There iss no database, all the data is hardcoded in the service files in the backend. The login system is essentially fake. I stored the login credentials in a variable instead of using cookies or sessions. Passwords are kept as raw, no hashing algorithms were used. You could add these features to turn the project into a fully functional app.

Basically a user can view the posts and users but in order to create a post, you need to log in. Once logged in you can create, edit, and delete your own posts.

![Assignment1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0410436a-3ad6-4bc3-874e-62139689bfe5)

If you log in as an admin, you can edit or delete all posts and users.

## Apart from these, some apps I wrote with JavaScript, HTML and CSS:

A web page that simulates gravity according to Newton's laws:

A fun app that can translate texts into different types of language games:

## Some applications I wrote with Python, Tkinter, PyQt:

A snake game where you can create users in the same computer and see the highscores of each user. The name comes from Python programming language. 

Source codes: <a href="https://github.com/ugurozdemir97/Snake-Game">Space Python</a>

This is how you create and delete players. You can see players' highscores in each difficulty and an average score.

A text editor where you can change font, background color, font size, and how you want the program to wrap text. It has all the basic functions like copy, cut, paste, save, open and you can view all the fonts.
